This is a very simple angular demonstration

run angular with the command `ng s --prod` or `ng s -aot` and look at the browser.


open a terminal to see that the url contains `undefined`
```
http://localhost:4200/undefined/api/v1/current-user
It should be  here:   ^^^^^^^^^ 
```

Also note the color of the loading background. To see the proper color and what the url should be run `ng s`

Feel free to comment and un-comment lines in any of the environments file.
